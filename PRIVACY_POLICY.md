# Privacy Policy for Double Click to Close Page

**Last Updated:** July 24, 2025

Thank you for using "Double Click to Close Page" (hereinafter referred to as "the Extension"). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy is intended to explain what data the Extension handles and why.

## 1. Data We Collect (or, More Accurately, Data We Interact With)

This Extension is designed with user privacy as a top priority. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information.

The only data the Extension interacts with is the following:

* **User Activity**: The Extension's core function is to listen for user's double-click events (`dblclick` and `contextmenu`) on web pages. This is considered "User Activity". This event data is processed locally within your browser in real-time to trigger the tab-closing function and is **never stored or sent anywhere**.
* **User Settings**: The Extension uses `chrome.storage.sync` to save your configuration from the options page (e.g., whether to enable right-click closing). This data is stored locally in your browser and synced to your own Google account, and is **not accessible by the developer**.

## 2. How We Use Data

* **User Activity (Clicks)**: The click event data is used solely and exclusively to determine when to close a browser tab, as per the Extension's purpose.
* **User Settings**: The settings data is used only to make the Extension function according to your preferences.

## 3. Data Sharing

We do not collect any personal data, therefore we **do not and cannot share or sell any data** to third parties.

## 4. Security

All data handled by the Extension (your settings) is managed by the secure, built-in Chrome Storage API.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

## 6. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can raise an issue on our GitHub Issues page.
